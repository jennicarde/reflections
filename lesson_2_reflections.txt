*What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?*
I don't know good question. Initialize means to create a repository.
You have to set it up before you can make manual commits. Otherwise git won't
run on your system.

*How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?*
The staging area is where items you select go to be committed to the repo.
The working directory is your local directory that you're working in.
The stating area means that you don't have to commit your whole directory
and you're able to select what items to choose in order to make a logical commit.

*How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?*
You can choose the files you want to commit using the staging area.

*What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?*
Branches are useful for:
1. testing a feature
2. making a different version

*How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?*
The diagrams (in the videos) help by making a tree of the branches in your repo.

*What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?*
You merge features, add features, fix bugs, etc. The main branch keeps the
commit history of both branches. We use the diagram because we can see which
commits are in the history.

*What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?*
++ More efficient. Faster.
-- Can't always choose. Sometimes two of same thing with different names maybe.
