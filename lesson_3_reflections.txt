*When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?*
Most of the time. Computers crash.

*Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?*
Because you decide what you want to share since GitHub is public.

*Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?*
Forks clone a branch on GitHub.
Clones clone a repo to your local machine.
Branches are part of both forks and clones.

*What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?*
You can do a fast-forward merge. *i don't know the answer to this question*

*How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?*
It would be harder overall because we would have to check line by line
ourselves. We'd have to manual merge documents. It might be easier to visual
if it were not in Git. GitHub has an interface which might make then easier.

*When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?*
I answered this in lesson 2. In additional to those reason, because of
collaboration with others. You can't all update the master.
